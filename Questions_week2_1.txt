dat = read.csv("femaleMiceWeights.csv")

Q1:How many of the high fat mice weigh less than the mean of the control mice 

(chow)?

sum(dat[13:24,2] < mean(dat[1:12,2]))

Q2:How many of the control mice weigh more than the mean of the high fat mice?

sum(dat[1:12,2] > mean(dat[13:24,2]))

Q3:The proportion of high fat diet mice over 30 is the sum of high fat diet 

mice over 30 divided by the number of high fat diet mice, in other words, the 

mean of a vector of 1s and 0s. What is the proportion of high fat diet mice 

over 30

mean(dat$hf > 30)



Q4:What's the control population mean?
population = read.csv("femaleControlsPopulation.csv")
mean(population)

Q5:What is the one-tailed probability of seeing as big a difference as we 

observed, calculated from your null distribution?

null = replicate(10000, mean(sample(population, 12)) - mean(sample(population, 

12)))

diff = mean(dat[13:24,2]) - mean(dat[1:12,2])

mean(null > abs(diff))

Q6:What is the two-tailed probability of seeing as big a difference as we 

observed, calculated from your null distribution?

mean(abs(null) > abs(diff))
