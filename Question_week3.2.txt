Week3 Inference II


Question 1.1 (1/1 point)

Take a random sample of N=30 measurement from each of the smoking and nonsmoking 

datasets. Then compute the difference in their means and construct a 95% 

confidence interval for the difference using t.test(). Do this 1,000 times and 

keep track of all the confidence intervals. One way to answer this question is 

to use the replicate() function in R, which will return a 2 x 1000 matrix of the 

lower and upper bound for each of the 1000 replications.

What is the average length of the confidence interval?

R-Code:

N=30
> conf.int<-function(){
+     sample.bwt.nonsmoke <- sample(bwt.nonsmoke,N)
+     sample.bwt.smoke <- sample(bwt.smoke,N)
+     bwt.test <- t.test(sample.bwt.nonsmoke,sample.bwt.smoke)
+     return (bwt.test$conf.int[2] - bwt.test$conf.int[1])
+ }
> mean(replicate(1000, conf()))


Question 1.2 (1 point possible)

The population-level difference was

popdiff = mean(bwt.nonsmoke) - mean(bwt.smoke)

How often (what proportion of times) did the confidence intervals contain the 

population-level difference? That is, what proportion of times was the lower 

bound of the confidence interval less than popdiff and the upper bound greater 

than popdiff?


R-Code
popdiff = mean(bwt.nonsmoke) - mean(bwt.smoke)
N=30
diff.compare<-function(){
  sample.bwt.nonsmoke <- sample(bwt.nonsmoke,N)
  sample.bwt.smoke <- sample(bwt.smoke,N)
  bwt.test <- t.test(sample.bwt.nonsmoke,sample.bwt.smoke)
  return (popdiff>bwt.test$conf.int[1] & popdiff<bwt.test$conf.int[2])
}
mean(replicate(1000, diff.compare()))


Questions 1.3 and 1.4



In the previous video Rafa mentioned that we should report confidence intervals 

whenever possible because they communicate both an effect size and the 

statistical significance of a result. Rafa later mentions that when comparing a 

difference between two groups to zero, we can tell whether the difference has a 

p-value of less than 0.05 based on whether the confidence interval for the 

difference contains zero. We will explore that statement in more detail in the 

next two questions.

Suppose that we have drawn samples of size N=30 from the non-smoking and smoking 

baby populations and we want to test whether the difference between their means 

is significant at the alpha=0.05 level.

Recall that when we perform a t-test for the difference between two means, we 

calculate a t-value like the following.

dat.ns = sample(bwt.nonsmoke, 30)
dat.s = sample(bwt.smoke, 30)
X.ns = mean(dat.ns)
sd.ns = sd(dat.ns)
X.s = mean(dat.s)
sd.s = sd(dat.s)
sd.diff = sqrt(sd.ns^2/30 + sd.s^2/30)
tval = (X.ns - X.s)/sd.diff

Because our sample sizes are rather large, we can then use the qnorm() function 

to tell whether tval corresponds to a p-value that is less than 0.05.

qnorm(1-0.05/2)

This tells us that if the absolute value of tval is greater than 1.96, the p-

value is less than 0.05 and the result is significant an the 0.05 level.

We can use the same numbers to construct a confidence interval for the 

difference in means between the smoking and nonsmoking populations. To do this, 

we follow Rafa's instruction in the CI 2 video

ci.upper = (X.ns-X.s) + sd.diff*1.96
ci.lower = (X.ns-X.s) - sd.diff*1.96

Question 1.3 

Fill in the blank: the difference in means (X.ns - X.s) must have absolute value 

greater than _____ times sd.diff in order for the result to be significant (at 

alpha=0.05).

Answer:1.96


Question 1.4 (1/1 point)

Fill in the blank: the difference in means (X.ns - X.s) must be a greater 

distance than _____ times sd.diff away from 0 in order for the 95% confidence 

interval not to contain 0.

Answer:1.96
