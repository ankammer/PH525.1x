Q1:
# subset all the values from 1952
df<-Subset(gapminder, gapminder$year <= 1952)
# subset all life Expectancies under 40
df1<-subset(df$lifeExp>=40)

# Calculatate proportion
nrow(df1)/nrow(df)

Q2:
# subset life Expectancies over 60
df2<-subset(df,df$lifeExp <= 60)

# Calculate proportion
 t<-nrow(df2)/nrow(df)
> s<-nrow(df1)/nrow(df)
> t-s

Part 2: What is the standard deviation of the log10 of population size of the 

countries in 1952?

R-Code:
t<-log10(new$pop)
sd(t)

Q2: What is the z-score of the country with the largest population size? (you 

can use tail(sort(z),1) to see the very last and largest value).

R-Code:
z <- (max(t)-mean(t))/sd(t)
max(z)

Q3:Finally, using the Normal approximation, estimate the number of countries 

that should have a log10 1952 population between 6 and 7 (i.e., between 1 

million and 10 million people)? The answer should be the proportion from the 

normal approximation times the total number of countries.

R-Code:
F <- function(q) pnorm(q, mean=mean(t), sd=sd(t))
(F(7) - F(6)) * length(t)



Q4:What is the quantile of the standard normal distribution which matches to 

the smallest number in x (the first element of sort(x))?


n = length(x)
ps = ((1:n) - 0.5)/n
min(qnorm(ps))
