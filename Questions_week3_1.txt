babies = read.table("babies.txt", header=TRUE)
bwt.nonsmoke = babies$bwt[babies$smoke==0]
bwt.smoke = babies$bwt[babies$smoke==1]
mean(bwt.nonsmoke)-mean(bwt.smoke)

Week3 Question1 Interference 1
Compute the t-value (t-statistic) for the first 30 weights of non-smoking 

mothers and the first 30 weights of smoking mothers. (The first 30 as they 

appear in the bwt.nonsmoke and bwt.smoke). Confirm that the t-statistic 

calculated manually and by t.test() is the same. What is the t-value (t-

statistic)?

R-Code:
bwt.nonsmoke30<-bwt.nonsmoke[1:30]
bwt.smoke30<-bwt.smoke[1:30]
t.test(bwt.nonsmoke30, bwt.smoke30)$statistic
        

Question2

Because of the symmetry of the standard normal distribution, there is a simpler 

way to calculate the probability that a t-value under the null could have a 

larger absolute value than tval. Choose the simplified calculation from the 

following:
 pval = 1- pnorm(abs(tval)) + pnorm(-abs(tval))

Answer:
2*pnorm(-abs(tval))



Question 3
Which of the following sentences about a Type I error is NOT true?

Answer:
The probability of making a Type I error is equal to the probability that the 

null hypothesis is true
