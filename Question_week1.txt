Q1: How many hours of total sleep are there for the first animal in the table? 

q$sleep_total[1]

Q2:What is the 3rd quartile of the total sleep of all the animals?
quantile(q$sleep_total,0.75)

Q3:What is the row number of the animal which has more than 18 hours of total 

sleep and less than 3 hours of

which(q$sleep_total >=18 & q$sleep_rem <= 3)

Q4: What is the index of the animal (so the row number) with the least total 

sleep?

which(q$sleep_total==min(q$sleep_total))

Q5: What's the rank of the animal in the first row of the table in terms of 

total sleep?

rank(q$sleep_total)

Q7:What is the row number for "Cotton rat" in the tab dataframe?

match("Cotton rat", q$name)


Q8:How many rodents (Rodentia) are in the table

table(q$order)

Q9:What is the mean hours of total sleep of the rodents?

s = split(q$sleep_total, q$order)
mean(s[["Rodentia"]])


Q10: What is the standard deviation of total hours of sleep for the Primates 

Order? (The standard deviation function is sd() in R.)

tapply(tab$sleep_total, tab$order, sd)
